### Why use CSS to add effects to your site instead of JavaScript? When might it be better to use JavaScript?

* css has faster framerates and smooter animations
* it is easier to handle and if there is an erronous line it would not crash the whole page

### What do the percentages within keyframes animations mean? How do you set how long the animation should take to run? 

* percentages denote the stage of the transition. 0% is the start of the transition and 100% is the end of it.
